# Troubleshooting CORS and Authentication Issues

## Problem Overview
Our application was encountering 401 Unauthorized errors and CORS issues when trying to load 3D models in the model history section. This was manifesting as:

1. Failed requests with 401 (Unauthorized) responses
2. Browser console errors: `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 401 ()`
3. Error messages like: `Error: Could not load [URL]: fetch for [URL] responded with 401`

## Root Causes

1. **Missing Authentication Headers**: When the proxy-model function was fetching external resources, it wasn't forwarding the necessary authentication tokens required by services like Meshy.ai.

2. **CORS Restrictions**: Modern browsers enforce Same-Origin Policy, preventing web pages from making requests to different domains without proper CORS headers.

3. **Authorization Token Handling**: The authorization tokens weren't being properly passed through the proxy chain.

## Solution Implementation

We made the following changes to address these issues:

### 1. Enhanced the Proxy Edge Function
- Added support for passing Authorization headers from the original request
- Implemented specific header handling for Meshy.ai API requests
- Added robust error handling and logging
- Improved response handling to maintain content types

```typescript
// Key improvements in proxy-model edge function
const headers = new Headers();
const authHeader = req.headers.get("Authorization");

if (authHeader) {
  headers.append("Authorization", authHeader);
}

// Add additional headers needed for Meshy API
if (modelUrl.includes("meshy.ai")) {
  const MESHY_API_KEY = Deno.env.get("MESHY_API_KEY") || "";
  if (MESHY_API_KEY) {
    headers.append("Authorization", `Bearer ${MESHY_API_KEY}`);
  }
}

const modelResponse = await fetch(modelUrl, {
  headers: headers
});
```

### 2. Updated the ThreeScene Component
- Added better error handling and reporting
- Implemented an ErrorBoundary to gracefully handle model loading failures
- Added detailed logging to help diagnose issues
- Improved the loading state management

### 3. Updated the Store Functions
- Ensured proper authentication token passing when making API calls
- Enhanced error handling in model downloading and viewing
- Improved the model URL handling to work with the proxy

## Testing the Solution
To verify the fix:
1. Sign in to your account
2. Generate a new 3D model (or view existing ones)
3. Go to the model history section
4. Verify that models load correctly without 401 errors
5. Test downloading models to ensure that also works

## Prevention Measures
To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Authentication Check**: Always verify authentication requirements when accessing external APIs
2. **CORS Awareness**: Be mindful of CORS restrictions when designing frontend-to-API interactions
3. **Proper Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling for all network requests
4. **Logging**: Add detailed logging to help diagnose issues quickly
