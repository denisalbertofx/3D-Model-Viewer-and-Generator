# Backend and Frontend Modules

## Overview
This module enhances the 3D Generator platform with a modern, responsive UI system using ShadCN UI and Framer Motion animations, along with a robust backend storage solution for models and user data.

## Backend Module

### Supabase Storage Implementation
- **Secure File Storage**: Comprehensive utilities for handling 3D model files in Supabase Storage
- **Upload Management**: Progress tracking and error handling for file uploads
- **Download Services**: Secure file retrieval for downloaded models
- **Access Control**: Row-level security policies enforce proper access permissions

### Storage Utilities
- `uploadFile`: Uploads files with progress tracking and proper metadata
- `downloadFile`: Retrieves files with proper error handling
- `deleteFile`: Manages file deletion with proper permissions
- `listFiles`: Lists available files for an authenticated user
- `createSignedUrl`: Creates temporary access URLs for sharing
- `ensureBucketExists`: Ensures storage buckets are properly configured

### API Integration
- **3D Generation API Proxy**: Secure communication with third-party 3D generation services
- **Authentication Handling**: Proper token management for API requests
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

## Frontend Module

### UI System Enhancements
- **ShadCN UI Components**: Modern, accessible UI components based on Radix UI primitives
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Complete theme system with automatic system preference detection
- **Toast Notifications**: Informative notification system for user feedback
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with adaptable layouts for all devices

### Animation System
- **Framer Motion Integration**: Smooth, performant animations throughout the UI
- **Interaction Feedback**: Micro-interactions for buttons, cards, and UI elements
- **Page Transitions**: Seamless transitions between different application states
- **Loading States**: Animated loading indicators and progress visualizations

### Enhanced Components
- **FileUploader**: Modern file upload component with drag-and-drop and progress tracking
- **AnimatedModelCard**: Interactive cards for displaying 3D model thumbnails and metadata
- **ModeToggle**: Animated theme switcher with system preference detection
- **ThemeProvider**: Context provider for theme state management throughout the app

## Accessibility Features
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Proper focus management
- ARIA attributes for UI components

## File Structure
- `lib/storage.ts`: Backend storage utility functions
- `lib/utils.ts`: Shared utility functions
- `components/ui/*`: ShadCN UI components
- `components/ThemeProvider.tsx`: Theme management
- `components/ModeToggle.tsx`: Theme toggle component
- `components/FileUploader.tsx`: File upload component
- `components/AnimatedModelCard.tsx`: 3D model display card

## Security Considerations
- Secure file uploads with proper validation
- JWT token validation for API requests
- Content type validation for file uploads
- Proper error handling to prevent information leakage

## Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading of components
- Code splitting for optimal bundle size
- Optimized animations with Framer Motion
- Efficient state management with Zustand

## Next Steps
- Implement full model gallery with filtering and sorting
- Add admin dashboard for platform monitoring
- Enhance mobile experience with touch-optimized controls
- Implement full-text search for models
